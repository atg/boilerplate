# Boilerplate Source Code

This repo will contain templates for boilerplate code in various languages.

For instance, the file `html/html5` contains your usual html/head/body song and dance.

## License

All code is made available under the WTFPL. By contributing any code (e.g. via a pull request) you agree to perpetually license your code under that license. Though since this is all boilerplate code used in thousands of files already, not much of it is copyrightable.
